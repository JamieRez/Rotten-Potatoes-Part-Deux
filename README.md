# Rotten Potatoes App: Part Deux

## What you will learn

To start this tutorial you must have finished the first Rotten Potatoes App.

Now there is much more to do. Rotten Potatoes is a bit limited and a bit old fashioned, and lacking tests it is not really production ready. We're going to perform the equivalent of open heart surgery on your first Rotten Potatoes App to upgrade its architecture and functionality.

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Use a GitHub **Feature Branch** strategy to refactor a project
* Using an external API add a third resource: Movies
* Use more advanced associations and queries in Mongoose
* Refactor your app to use a **Client-Side Architecture**
* Using Axios on the client to do PUT, POST, and DELETE actions to the server
* Add star rating reviews
* Add testing to each of your routes
