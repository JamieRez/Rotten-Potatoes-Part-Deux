We've been putting all our logic in one file `app.js`, except our views. Now we are going to create a new folder called `models`, and create a file in there called `project.js`. This is where we'll keep our model logic for our Project resource.

```bash
$ mkdir models
$ cd models
$ touch project.js
$ cd .. # TO RETURN TO THE ROOT FOLDER OF OUR PROJECT
```
